## Business Questions Addressed
1. What features drive Airbnb listing prices in NYC?  
2. Can we predict if a listing includes a cleaning fee?  
3. Can we classify Airbnb rentals into price tiers?  
4. Can we predict cancellation policies based on listing features?  
5. How can we group Brooklyn neighborhoods based on listing characteristics?
