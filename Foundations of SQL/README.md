This project serves as an introductory journey into the world of Structured Query Language (SQL) and relational database management systems (RDBMS). It covers 
fundamental SQL commands and concepts in three sections:

1. *Absolute Fundamentals*: Creating, populating, and manipulating a "Cars" table.
2. *More Precise Data Handling*: Refining SQL skills with an "Apartments" table, including constraints, null values, and targeted operations.
3. *Data Anomalies and Formats*: Exploring anomalies in table design and comparing data access between relational tables and file formats.
   
Overall, this project showcases foundational SQL skills essential for effective database management.
