This database project involves SQL to aggregate data within a simplified dinosaur discovery schema. Key tasks include creating and populating tables, performing various
data aggregation tasks such as counting, finding highest and lowest values, and grouping results. Additionally, the project explores data visualization by creating bar 
charts and scatterplots to convey insights derived from the database. Ultimately, the skills acquired in this project are valuable for making data-driven decisions in 
fields such as paleontology and museum management.
