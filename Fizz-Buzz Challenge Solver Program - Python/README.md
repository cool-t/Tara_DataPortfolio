# Fizz-Buzz Python Challenge Solver

This Python program is a solution to the Fizz-Buzz challenge, customized as part of an academic assignment. It iterates through numbers from 1 to 30, 
checking for divisibility by 2, 3, and 5, and prints specific strings accordingly. The program uses both for and while loops to display the output, with a 
separator line between them.

## Description of Code

The program begins by declaring a constant variable `MAXVAL` with a value of 30. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 30 and checks 
each number for divisibility by 2, 3, and 5. Depending on the divisibility, it prints "foo," "bar," and "baz" individually or in combination.

After the `for` loop, the program prints a separator line and repeats the process using a `while` loop.

## Instructions for Running Code

This program is written in Python and can be run using a Python interpreter. No additional dependencies are required. Follow these steps to run the program:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Save the program code to a Python file, e.g., `tcool_fizzbuzz.py`.

3. Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.

4. Run the program using the following command:

   > python tcool_fizzbuzz.py
   
6. The program will execute and display the Fizz-Buzz output for numbers from 1 to 30.
